# node-l8

A nodejs library to talk to the [L8 Smartlight](http://www.l8smartlight.com/).

As all of the currently available SDK versions (especially the JavaScript one) did not work for me. I decided to quickly hack my own implementation based on [node-serialport](https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-serialport).


## Status

The currently available library is a definitive work in progress. I just pushed it for some friends to play with. Expect some updates soon. As soon as it does provide some useful functions I will push it to npm as well.
The API is currently quite fluid. Don't expect it to be stable at all.
