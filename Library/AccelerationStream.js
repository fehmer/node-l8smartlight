/**
 * Time based stream of acceleration data from the L8.
 *
 * The stream is an object mode stream. It therefore does not return a buffer
 * if read, but one Acceleration data struct at a time. The data structure is
 * identical with the one you would get from the {@link L8#getAcceleration} method.
 *
 * The L8 only provides the Acceleration information if they are polled. This
 * stream takes care of polling the data at a given sampling rate and providing
 * it to you in an easily accessible way.
 *
 * The stream automatically takes care of starting and stopping the data polling
 * once a *listener* is connected or disconnected. Therefore you do not need to
 * take care of this nasty business yourself.
 *
 * The Stream needs an instance of the L8 class to attach to, as well as an optional
 * `samplingRate_`. The sampling rate tells the system which timeframe (in msec) should be
 * waited between two data polls. If none is given `100 msec` is assumed by default.
 *
 * In order to utilize the Stream simply wrap it around an L8 instance and attach to the
 * corresponding [Stream](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable)
 * event handlers:
 *
 * @example ```
 *  var l8 = //...
 *
 *  var acceleration = new AccelerationStream(l8, 200);
 *  acceleration.on("data", function(data) {
 *      // Do something with each part of the acceleration data here.
 *  });
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively the convenience function {@link L8#createAccelerationStream} can
 * be used to get an already connected stream directly from an L8 instance
 *
 * @example ```
 *  var l8 = //...
 *  var acceleration = l8.createAccelerationStream(200);
 *  acceleration.on("data", function(data) {
 *      // Do something with each part of the acceleration data here.
 *  });
 * ```
 *
 * @param {L8} l8 Instance of the L8 to attach to.
 * @param {int} [samplingRate]
 * @constructor
